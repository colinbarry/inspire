Box breathing is a simple breathing technique that brings profound benefits. In
fact, even the US Navy SEALs, some of the world's toughest soldiers, use it in
high-stress situations. Also known as "square breathing" or "four-square
breathing," this controlled breathing practice is based on pranayama, an
Ayurvedic form of breathwork that originated in India. Box breathing is known
for improving physiological responses, helping to calm the mind, and bringing
focus. ([Calm](https://blog.calm.com/blog/box-breathing))
